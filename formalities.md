## Licensing
To ensure the long-term management of Hydra source code and documentation, all contributors and
their employers are required to sign license agreements based on the Apache license.  Although
it's a hurdle that new contributors have to clear, these license agreements keep Hydra on solid
ground as dozens of partner institutions build repositories using the Hydra stack.

Individuals are required to sign an Individual Contributor License Agreement (iCLA) covering their
own contributions.  In addition, if you work for an institution which has rights over your
contributions, then your employer must sign also a Corporate Contributor License Agreement (cCLA).
The license agreement templates are available from the [Hydra Project Intellectual Property
Licensing and Ownership](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/Hydra+Project+Intellectual+Property+Licensing+and+Ownership) page, and contributors who have signed a CLA are listed on the
[CLA Submission List](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/CLA+submission+list).


## Membership in GitHub organizations and repositories
Once you have a CLA on file, you're welcome and encouraged to be a member of any Github
organizations and repositories you want to work with.  If you need access, ask in a Github issue
or on [Slack](communication.md#slack) and someone will add you.  It's also fine if you would
rather fork any projects you want to work on, and contribute via pull request only.
