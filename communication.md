# Communication

There are many ways to connect with fellow Hydra community members (you're in the community now, too; welcome!). The choices below may seem bewildering. We provide all the options below because we acknowledge that we all have different communication styles.

This page details the communication channels used by developers in the Hydra community.  For more
information on broader community communication, please see the Hydra wiki
[Get in touch!](https://wiki.duraspace.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=43910187) page.

## Regular Calls

* [Weekly Technical Call](https://wiki.duraspace.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=43910187#Getintouch!-TechnicalCall) for technical discussion, and coordinating releases and code review
* [Monthly Partner Call](https://wiki.duraspace.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=43910187#Getintouch!-MonthlyPartnerCall) complements the tech call with a focus on community and functional progress
* Community Sprint Calls are also organized to coordinate development

## Slack

Slack has become the primary mode of synchronous communication in the Hydra community. There is a Hydra Slack team that is used for discussion, questions, announcements, interest groups, and working groups. Topics span very general discussion to in-depth interest/working group work, from metadata work to development coordination. Anyone can create a new channel within the Hydra Slack team once they have registered for an account.

* Slack: http://project-hydra.slack.com/
* Signup form: http://slack.projecthydra.org/

## Mailing Lists

* https://groups.google.com/group/hydra-community for general Hydra discussion
* https://groups.google.com/group/hydra-tech for technical discussion
* and several more listed in the [Hydra wiki](https://wiki.duraspace.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=43910187#Getintouch!-MailingLists)

## Wiki

* DuraSpace wiki: https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/The+Hydra+Project for general project
  documentation, meeting notes, and working group pages
  * To request an account, please email [sysadmin@duraspace.org](mailto:sysadmin@duraspace.org)
* GitHub codebase-specific wikis for technical documentation and tutorials: e.g.,
  * https://github.com/projecthydra/hydra-head/wiki
  * https://github.com/projecthydra/sufia/wiki

## Conferences

* [HydraConnect](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/Hydra+Connect+Meetings): the annual go-to
  event for the entire Hydra community, primarily geared towards connecting with fellow Hydra
  community members to learn how they are using Hydra
* Developer Congresses: these community hackfests tend to be held 1-2 times per year, and have a strong record of delivering advances in our community codebases and helping to onboard new Hydra developers
* Other Conferences
  * [Code4lib](http://code4lib.org/conference)
  * [LDCX](http://library.stanford.edu/projects/ldcx)
  * [Open Repositories](http://openrepositories.org/)
  * [Digital Library Federation Forum](https://www.diglib.org/forums/)

## Training

* [HydraCamp](https://curationexperts.com/our-services/hydra-camp/): for many partners, one of the
  first steps to joining the Hydra community was, and remains, sending a team of software developers
  to HydraCamp to learn the common practices of our community. We generally hold 3-4 HydraCamps per
  year.

## IRC

Slack is more active, but there is still a #projecthydra IRC channel on chat.freenode.net.  Connect
using your favorite IRC client, or using http://webchat.freenode.net/.  If you are new to IRC, the
Code4lib [IRC wiki page](http://code4lib.org/irc) is a good introduction.
